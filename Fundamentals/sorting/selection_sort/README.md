For selection sort, we go through every item in the array
And try to sort them, and by doing so we need to first find the smallest
To make things easy we can just let the first value be the smallest
Then we start to compare the next value if its less than then switch place
Repeat that for the length of the array 
Since the time complexity is linear time log(n) for going through
But we are doing it n amount if time 
Total time complextity is then log(n * n) = log(n^2)
